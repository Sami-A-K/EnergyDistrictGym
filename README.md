# EnergyDistrictGym

EnergyDistrictGym is a reinforcement learning environment designed for energy management in multi-building energy systems. The environment provides several energy system components to model an individual multi-building energy system. It enables the development and benchmarking of control policies with different optimization objectives for the modelled systems to help with a faster implementation of energy management in complex multi-building energy system projects.
